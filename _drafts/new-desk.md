title: "Finding a new desk"
---

I have a little bit of room width-wise and quite a lot of room upwards so looking at a hutch desk.
Want storage at the sides as well.
Needs to take a 27" monitor and would like (or be able to add) a keyboard tray.
Spend a reasonably amount of time at the desk so need to be able to sit comfortably at it - e.g. nothing blocking legs, monitor can sit square in-front of keyboard and chair.

Corner desk is an option in this room but is it always convenient?
Added bonuses would be places to stash by NAS and speaks and cable tidying.

Figure adding storage to the sides is probably easier than attaching a hutch later.
