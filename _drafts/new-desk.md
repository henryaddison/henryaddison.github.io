title: "Finding a new desk"
---

My current desk is a bit too small and is surrounded by some nasty, cheap plastic drawers with things barely balanced on top. Time for a new desk.

I have a little bit of room width-wise and quite a lot of room upwards.
It needs to take a 27" monitor and have a keyboard tray.
I spend a reasonably amount of time at the desk so I need to be able to sit comfortably at it. For example, nothing blocking legs and monitor can sit square in-front of keyboard and chair.
Ideally it would have storage at the sides as well.
Added bonuses would be places to stash by NAS and speaks and cable tidying.

A hutch seems sensible to make use of the space above and figure finding storage for the sides is probably easier than attaching a hutch later.
With the right desk it would be possible to add a keyboard tray later.
Corner desk is an option in this room but is it always convenient?

Most awesome would be to build the desk myself so I can get exactly what I want.

At the moment have a short-list of 3:

1. [Ikea HEMNES with add-on unit](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S29000504/#/S29000504)
2. [Ikea MICKE corner workstation](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/50250713/)
3. [Tvilum Function Plus Computer Desk](http://www.wayfair.co.uk/Function-Plus-Computer-Desk-5706887852927-TVK2979.html)

The HEMNES is top choice but with a large caveat - I'm don't think my 27" monitor will fit. However, possibly my 25" from work might and that may be a sensible swap. It has no keyboard try but Internet suggests it's possible to hack one in.

The MICKE is nice and compact and a corner desk could work well in current placement but I worry a decently sized monitor will not fit in the corner recess and so lose a lot of space. Again no keyboard tray and not as convinced it will be easy to add one to the MICKE since it's particle board rather than solid word.

The Tvilum doesn't have as much of a hutch as I'd like (more like a raised shelf) but has lots of storage around it.

Perhaps a trip to Ikea with a tape measure is in order since I can't find detailed measures of the HEMNES or MICKE to check about screens.
