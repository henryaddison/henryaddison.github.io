This is my blog.

I'm a PhD student at the [Interactive AI CDT, University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) ([go 2020 Cohort](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/current-students/2020-cohort/)). I'm interested in the application of AI to Climate Science (one day there might be more on [my University profile](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/henry-addison)).
