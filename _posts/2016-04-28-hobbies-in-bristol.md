title: "Finding my feet in Bristol"
---

I have enjoyed rowing in Bristol but the squad is struggling to make regular numbers and it's the only hobby I have in Bristol. Time to try out something new. And can write about what I do.

I have come up with a long list of things I might like to try without much thought to how possible it is to do them in Bristol.

* Painting or drawing
* Go back to Italian classes
* Go to classes for a new language
* Learn guitar or ukelele
* Piano - perhaps with some lessons this time
* Return to learning Greek
* Cross-stitch
* Pool and snooker
* Volunteering
* Climbing
* Dancing
* Photography
* Carpentry
* Scuba diving
* Football
* Cricket
* Build robots
* Pottery
* Ice skating
* Sailing
* Yoga and pilates
* Board games
* Film making
* Cooking
* Brewing
* Astronomy
* Graffiti
* Make a website
* Kaggle competitions
* Make data visualizations
