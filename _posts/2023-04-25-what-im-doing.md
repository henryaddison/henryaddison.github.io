Following [the advice of doing short blogposts](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2019/06/25/write-short-blogposts), let's give it ago.

Currently I am:

* Helping to organise the Interactive AI CDT Spring Research Conference.
* Preparing for two conferences in April: Climate Informatics 2023 in Cambridge and EGU 23 in Vienna.
* Improving my diffusion-model-based hi-res climate model emulator.
