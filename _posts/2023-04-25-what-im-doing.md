Following [the advice of doing short blogposts](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2019/06/25/write-short-blogposts), let's give it ago.

Currently I am:

* Helping to organise the [Interactive AI CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) Spring Research Conference.
* Preparing for two conferences in April: [Climate Informatics 2023](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/main/2023/01/01/ci2023.html) in Cambridge and [EGU 23](https://www.egu23.eu/) in Vienna.
* Improving my diffusion-model-based hi-res climate model emulator. 

## Organising IAI CDT Spring Research Conference

Organising this has been both fun (we get to choose some of the stuff that happens) and frustrating (when a speaker we ask isn't available on the dates; worrying the other CDT students think it's all a waste of time). The main purpose of it is for students of the CDT to present our research to each other but we've got a couple of interesting speakers coming and hopefully we've have some fun too.

## Conferences

Looking forward to finally getting to a conference in-person (Covid and caring responsibilities make this not so simple) but not really sure what to expect at a scientific conference and how to make it useful.

## Improving my diffusion model

Bit overwhelmed by this:

* Quantile Mapping
* Working out why my RAPSD plots are weird
* Evaluating the probalistic part of ML model
* Climate change signal response
* Communicating variability in QQ plots and bias (so variability in CPM and sample quantiles over all locations, CPM and sample means at each location)
* Puttingn together a paper
* Figuring what the hell will my thesis contain
* Better way to display samples
* Picking and fitting some decent baselines (GAN, deterministic UNet, GLMs that perhaps can't do spatially coherent single samples)
