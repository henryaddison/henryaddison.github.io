This week I started work on my summer project. My supervisors are Peter Watson, Laurence Aitchison and Dann Mitchell so I'm part of Laurence's lab group and the [Climate Dynamics Group](https://www.climatebristol.org/).

The project is using ML to speed-up the downscaling of high resolution (in our case 2.2km grid) precipitation projections (or in other words emulating a CP model). This is based on the UKCP18 dataset.
